abstract = {Not for sale in the USA {\&} Canada The eagerly anticipated Fourth Edition of the title that pioneered the comparison of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research design is here! For all three approaches, Creswell includes a preliminary consideration of philosophical assumptions, a review of the literature, an assessment of the use of theory in research approaches, and reflections about the importance of writing and ethics in scholarly inquiry. He also presents the key elements of the research process, giving specific attention to each approach. The Fourth Edition includes extensively revised mixed methods coverage, increased coverage of ethical issues in research, and an expanded emphasis on worldview perspectives. PRAISE FOR CRESWELL'S RESEARCH DESIGN: 'It provides all of the necessary information and tools to guide my doctoral students through writing their dissertation (research) proposals. Each chapter provides content information, examples that demonstrate the application of the content, suggestions for writing activities, and additional resources. All of this together in one textbook is phenomenal.' — R.M. Cooper, Drake University 'Creswell's is a more comprehensive discussion of design. Most texts approach this issue as either a book on qualitative methods, or one on quantitative methods. Additionally, my students appreciate the language. While not simple, the language and tone in this book are both accessible and inviting.' — Gilberto Arriaza, California State University-East Bay 'The accessibility of the content is a key strength. The students indicated that they will continue to use as a resource after the class is over.' — Heather J. Brace, Whittier College},
